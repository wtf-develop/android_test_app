# Android Test Application
Kitty list. Here I will test some "modern like" libraries. Single Activity application with multiple Fragments. 

I try to build app with one Activity aand Navigation object with a lot of Fragments inside it as navigation targets.
Try to use Interfaces where its possible. Tests, tests, tests!!! later... Its not a TDD

This is a story how small homemade app with 3-4 screens became commercial huge heavyweight project with many dependencies. And a story about how a project that can be completed in 3-4 days of normal development, can be developed in a few months with complete testable code.

I hope I have enough enthusiasm. If you want to add a ray of light into this darkness, then you can always [>> Donate <<](https://paypal.me/LeonidDonate)

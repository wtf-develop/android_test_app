# Android Test Application
Kitty list. Here I will test some "modern like" libraries. Single Activity application with multiple Fragments. 

I try to build app with one Activity as Navigation object and a lot of Fragments inside it as navigation targets.
Try to use Interfaces where its possible. Tests, later... Its not a TDD

# Android Kitty Application
Kitty list. Daily updated list with cats. What i can tell yu more about this app?

You can rate cats, you can add cats to the list. This app only supports direct web links starting with http:// or https://. There is no way to upload images from your device yet. Images are pre-moderated and will only be visible after approval

# Technical details
Single Activity application with multiple Fragments. 

I try to build App with one Activity and Navigation object, that control a lot of Fragments as navigation targets.

Dependency injection: HILT

Retrofit, Glide, RxKotlin

Tests, tests, tests!!! Some later... Its not a TDD
I use Interfaces where its possible for good testable code. 

# Abstract
This is a story how small homemade app with 3-4 screens became commercial huge heavyweight project with many dependencies. And a story about how a project that can be completed in 3-4 days of normal development, can be developed in a few months with complete testable code.
I hope I have enough enthusiasm.

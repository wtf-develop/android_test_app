### Technical details
Single Activity application with multiple Fragments. 

I try to build App with one Activity and Navigation object, that control a lot of Fragments as navigation targets.

Dependency injection: HILT

Retrofit, Glide, RxKotlin

### Tests
- Unit test
- Robolectric test
- Hilt test
- Espresso test coming soon...

I use Interfaces where its possible for good testable code. 

### Abstract
This is a story how small homemade app with 3-4 screens became commercial huge heavyweight project with many dependencies. And a story about how a project that can be completed in 3-4 days of normal development, can be developed in a few months with complete testable code.
I hope I have enough enthusiasm.
